		<p>I have been with HRE for the past five years and have had not only my car rebuilt from the ground up, with two engine swaps and much more. i can honestly say that there work is second to none and the attention to detail that the owner Paul takes on customizing several components shows the real dedication he has for engineering precision & perfection on a whole. would highly recommend HRE for any job little or small. - <strong>"Clive Jones"</strong> - Dublin - Ireland

		<p>After Experiencing a  freak fire accident in the engine bay of my morris minior due to an electrical fault ,I found it hard for a garage to carry out the necessary repairs my car needed. it was by chance that a friend had asked me to get in contact with HRE as they specialize in all things mini. i soon got in contact and from that point on i was amazed by the attention to detail the team at HRE Took from looking back through old photos i had of my car to use as a starting reference point to put my car right once again.
